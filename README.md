The Movie Booking System project in Golang is a console-based application that allows users to book movie tickets by entering theirdetails and the number of tickets they want. It tracks seat availability, validates user inputs (such as name, email, and ticket quantity),and books tickets by updating the remaining seats. This project also uses Goroutines to simulate sending confirmation tickets via emailin the background, ensuring concurrent ticket processing. This project demonstrates core Golang concepts like slices, structs,concurrency with time.sleep, and basic input/output handling.
